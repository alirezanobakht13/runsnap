## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: A run being logged on this host is shown live

When a selected run carries `runsnap.tb.local_host` equal to the viewing host's name and `runsnap.tb.local_dir` naming a directory that exists, `runsnap tb` SHALL show that run from that directory rather than from a downloaded snapshot, and SHALL NOT download that run's artifacts. TensorBoard's own reload SHALL then reflect events the training process has flushed since the dashboard was opened. Any other selected run SHALL be shown from its cached artifacts as before, and the two kinds SHALL appear together in one dashboard under their usual names.

#### Scenario: Dashboard follows training

- **WHEN** a run is training on this host with `runsnap.tensorboard()` and a user runs `runsnap tb <run>` while it is in progress
- **THEN** TensorBoard opens on the run's local log directory, downloads nothing for it, and shows new scalar points as training continues without the command being restarted

#### Scenario: Finished run falls back to artifacts

- **WHEN** a selected run carries the local tags but its directory no longer exists
- **THEN** the run is fetched from its artifacts and shown from the cache exactly as a run without the tags would be

#### Scenario: Run logged on another host

- **WHEN** a selected run carries `runsnap.tb.local_host` naming a different host
- **THEN** the run is fetched from its artifacts, even if a directory with the tagged path happens to exist here

#### Scenario: Live and cached runs together

- **WHEN** a user runs `runsnap tb <run> --chain` while `<run>` trains on this host and continues a finished earlier attempt
- **THEN** the live run is shown from its local directory and the earlier attempt from the cache, both under their run names

#### Scenario: Local directory is shown whole

- **WHEN** a live run has logged images and the user does not pass `--media`
- **THEN** the run's images are visible anyway, because the local directory is shown as it is and nothing was downloaded to omit

#### Scenario: Run killed without cleanup

- **WHEN** a run on this host was killed without leaving its writer block, so its local directory still exists
- **THEN** the run is shown from that directory, which holds every event flushed before the kill, including data never uploaded
